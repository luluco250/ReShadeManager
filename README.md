# ReShade Manager

Application for managing various ReShade effect repositories from a central location.

Still a bit of a proof-of-concept, currently has a bare-minimum CLI for updating and installing repositories.

A GUI is on the roadmap, but all core features should be implemented first.

For support or suggestions, you can also contact @luluco250 in the ReShade Discord, besides creating issues.
